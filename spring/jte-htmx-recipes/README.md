## Auto-complete search
HTMX doesn't have any concept of components. It took a while to figure out a custom auto-complete box from scratch with a lot of custom javascript and a lot of prompt coding. A simpler approach is always welcome.

### Search functionality demo 
from https://www.photondesigner.com/articles/database-search-django-htmx
Took a very long time to get it working with JTE since I don't know JTE and neither does OpenAI Jetbrains coding AI
And it wasn't even what I needed

### Another converted search example 
from https://github.com/johnthethird/sinatra-htmx/ but not really much there. Didn't get it fully working since it was too much effort for little value. Interesting primarily as a rapid showcase for code conversion from 1 language to another using Jetbrains AI assistant.

### TODO: 
1. Load YAML to get Ruby example working
2. Try out Claude generated example - [autocomplete.html](src/main/resources/templates/autocomplete.html)
3. Try out ChatGPT generated example - [](src/main/resources/templates/auto-complete.html) and convert it's supporting Python code [auto-complete.py](src/main/resources/templates/auto-complete.py) to Java
